Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.

4. Take the dough out of the bowl onto the kitchen surface and add salt.
5. Mix in the salt with the slap and fold technique until firm. Place back into the bowl and cover.
6. Coil fold the dough every 30-60 minutes

Shaping the Dough
7. After about 4h, lightly flower the work surface and pre-shape the dough into a ball.
8. Let it rest on the surface for 30 minutes.
9. Shape the dough into the desired shape
10. Place it into a banneton with plenty of flour and a linen towel, cover it and place it into the fridge overnight.

Baking
11. Preheat the oven to 250°C (top&bottom heat).
12. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
13. Bake for 10 minutes, then optionally do an expansion score and turn the oven down to 210°C for another 40 minutes.

## notes
* the dough will not hold it's form very well, so put it in the oven directly from the fridge.
