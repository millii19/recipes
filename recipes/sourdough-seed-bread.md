## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix the seeds together and add a bit of water, just enough that the seeds can absorb it and let it soak for a few minutes
2. Mix flour, salt, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.
3. Mix in the seeds.
4. Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.

Proofing
5. Fold the dough every 30-60 minutes.
6. After a couple of hours, form the dough and place it into a bannet
7. Place the dough in the fridge overnight

Baking
8. Preheat the oven to 250Â°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
9. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
10. Bake for 10 minutes then turn down the oven to 220 for another 40 minutes
