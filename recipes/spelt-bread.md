# WIP: Spelt Bread

## ingredients
* 550g spelt flour
* ~100g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
* 350g warm water (65%)
* 12g fine salt (2%)

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix spelt flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.
2. Fold the dough using a dough scraper until a smooth dough has formed.
3. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.
4. Take the dough out of the bowl onto the kitchen surface and add salt.
5. Mix in the salt with the slap and fold technique until firm. Place back into the bowl and cover.
6. Coil fold the dough every 30-60 minutes

Shaping the Dough
7. After a 75% rise of the volume is achieved, lightly flower the work surface and pre-shape the dough into a ball.
8. Let it rest on the surface for 30 minutes.
9. Shape the dough into the desired shape
10. Place it into a banneton with plenty of flour and a linen towel, cover it and place it into the fridge overnight.

Baking
11. Preheat the oven to 250°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
12. Take out the dough, flip it onto a floured baking sheet.
13. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
14. Turn the oven down to 220°C and bake for 50 minutes.

## notes
* you can add some herbs or seeds to the dough: add them at the same time with the salt and make sure they have soaked a bit in water first
* instead of a baking stone you can use a dutch oven, just make sure it was sufficiently preheated
