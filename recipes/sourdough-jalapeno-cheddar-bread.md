# Jalapeno Cheddar Sourdough

## ingredients
* 500g fine wheat flour
* 100g whole wheat flour
* ~100g sourdough starter
* 450g warm water (70%)
* 13g fine salt (2%)
* 150g cheddar cheese (diced or roughly chopped)
* 90g pickled jalapenos (chopped)

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter, water and salt until a rough dough has formed, knead it a bit until sticky.
2. Fold the dough using a dough scraper until a smooth dough has formed.
3. Carefully fold the dough every 30-60 minutes, wet your hands to smoothen the dough at the same time.
4. After the 3rd fold, spread out the dough on the counter top and add the cheddar and jalapenos while folding it into the dough. Make sure to squeeze out the juices of the pickled jalapenos before adding them.
5. Let the dough rest another 30min in the bowl before shaping

Shaping the Dough
6. After a few hours, flower the kitchen counter and put the dough ontop.
7. Shape the dough into the desired shape
8. Place it into a banneton with a linen towel, cover it and leave it in the fridge overnight.

Baking
9. Preheat the oven to 230°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a dutch-oven in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
10. Take out the dough, flip it onto a baking sheet.
11. Score the loaf and quickly place it in the dutch oven and put it back in the oven.
12. After 20 minutes remove the lid of the dutch-oven, turn the oven down to 210°C and bake for another 25 minutes until golden brown.

## notes
* you can add some herbs to the bread
* a baking stone can also work instead of the dutch-oven
