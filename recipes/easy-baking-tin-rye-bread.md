# WIP: Baking Tin Rye Bread

## ingredients
* 500g rye flour
* 100g fine wheat flour
* ~50g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
* 540g warm water (90%)
* 18g fine salt (3%)
* 6g whole cumin

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.
2. Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.
3. Add salt and cumin to the dough in the bowl
4. Fold the dough in the bowl using a scraper until the salt and cumin is evenly mixed
5. Cover and set aside in a warm place

Second Rise
6. After a 50% rise of the volume is achieved, pour the dough into a baking tin. You may want to use some parchment paper to keep the dough from sticking
7. Cover and let it rest until it rose a bit and a dome shape is visible. You can also put it in the fridge overnight

Baking
8. Preheat the oven to 250Â°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
9. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
10. Bake for 10 minutes then turn down the oven to 220 for another 40 minutes

## notes
* 1st attempt: too much dough for the baking tin, preferably should not rise overtop the edge, baked too hot, the top has a tough crust which makes this loaf difficult to cut, since the sides are not so tough
