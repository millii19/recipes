# WIP: Sunflower Rye Bread

## ingredients
* 400g wheat flour
* 200g rye flour
* ~50g sourdough starter
* 450g warm water (75%)
* 15g fine salt (3%)
* 60g sunflower seeds
* 20g leinsamen (geschrotet)
* 5g cumin

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.
2. Mix salt, sunflower seeds and the leinsamen with a splash of water in a separate bowl and let it soak.
3. Set aside both for 30 minutes for autolysis.
4. Mix in the salt/seed mixture into the dough by folding. Place back into the bowl and cover.
5. Coil fold the dough every 30-60 minutes

Shaping the Dough
6. After about 4h, shape the dough into the desired shape.
7. Place it into a banneton with plenty of flour and a linen towel, cover it and place it into the fridge overnight.

Baking
8. Preheat the oven to 250°C (top&bottom heat).
9. Take out the dough, flip it onto a floured baking sheet.
10. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
14. Bake for 10 minutes, then optionally do an expansion score and turn the oven down to 220°C and bake for another 40 minutes.

## notes
* instead of a baking stone you can use a dutch oven, just make sure it was sufficiently preheated
