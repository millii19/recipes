# Baking Tin Rye Bread

## ingredients
* 400g rye flour
* 200g fine wheat flour
* 200g whole wheat flour
* 200g spelt flour
* ~50g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
* 800g warm water (80%)
* 250g Magertopfen
* 150g mixed seeds (leinsamen and sunflower seeds)
* 20g fine salt (2%)
* 10g whole cumin

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix ingredients until a rough dough has formed.
2. Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.
3. Fold the dough in the bowl every 30-60min 3 times
4. Split the doigh and put it in 2 slightly buttered bread forms (30cm x 5cm)
5. Cover and set aside in a warm place overnight

Baking
6. The dough should have doubled or almost tripled in size and fill the bread forms 
7. Preheat the oven to 200°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
8. If the dough did not nearly triple overnight, make sure to score the loaf, because it may rise more in the oven.
9. Bake both loaves in the forms at once. First for 30 minutes on 200°C and then turn down the oven to 180 for another 60 minutes

## notes
* feel free to sprinkle some toppings on the loaves before proofing
