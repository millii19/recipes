# Rye Bread

## ingredients
* 550g rye flour
* 100g wheat flour
* ~100g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
* 450g warm water (70%)
* 13g fine salt (2%)
* 10g herbs (cumin + coriander + fennel)

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix all ingredients until a rough dough has formed, knead it a bit until sticky.
2. Fold the dough using a dough scraper until a smooth dough has formed.
3. Carefully fold the dough every 30-60 minutes, wet your hands to smoothen the dough at the same time.

Shaping the Dough
4. After a few hours, heavily flower the kitchen counter and put the dough ontop.
5. Shape the dough into the desired shape
6. Place it into a banneton with a linen towel, cover it and leave it at room temperature overnight.

Baking
7. Preheat the oven to 250°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
8. Take out the dough, flip it onto a floured pizza shover or similar.
9. Score the loaf and quickly place in the oven with some water or ice cubes to create some steam.
10. After 10 minutes, turn the oven down to 220°C and bake for another 40 minutes.

## notes
* you can add some seeds to the dough: add them at the same time with the salt and make sure they have soaked a bit in water first
* instead of a baking stone you can use a dutch oven, just make sure it was sufficiently preheated
* Rye dough is a bit strange, if behaves a bit like very sticky clay. When shaping the dough, don't use any fancy shaping techniques, just roughly shape into the desired shape with a lot of flower.
