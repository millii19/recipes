# Baking Pan Pizza

## ingredients
* 600g wheat flour
* ~100g sourdough starter
* 420g warm water (70%)
* 18g fine salt (3%)
* Some Semola flour for covering the baking pan and shaping

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough dough has formed.
2. Fold the dough using a dough scraper until a smooth dough has formed.
3. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.
4. Take the dough out of the bowl onto the kitchen surface and add salt.
5. Mix in the salt with the slap and fold technique until firm. Place back into the bowl and cover.
6. Leave at room temperature for 4h and optionally fold the dough every 30-60 minutes.
7. Cover the bowl with ceranwrap and place it in the fridge. There it can stay overnight or up to 48h.

Baking
8. Preheat the oven to 250Â°C (top&bottom heat). Preferably put a baking stone in the oven and let it heat up for 45 minutes.
9. Liberally flower the kitchen counter with semola flour and stretch the dough until it more or less reached the size of the baking sheet
10. Cover the baking pan with some semola flour and put the dough on top.
11. Spread the dough by dimpling and pushing down with your fingers to fill out the whole pan.
12. Add sauce and toppings to your liking
13. Put the pan in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes

## notes
* You can make more dough if you prefer a slightly thicker pizza base. Just add a couple of minutes for baking time and consider turning down the temperature a bit.
* If the dough does not easily strech or doesn't hold it's form, put it in the baking pan and let it rest for some time to allow it to spread out before dimpling.
