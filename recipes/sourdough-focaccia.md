# Focaccia
* Feeds 8 humans or 6 hungry monsters
* Amount of dough for a 35cm x 25cm x 7cm (~6L volume) oven dish

## ingredients
* 700g white flour
* ~100g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
* 580g warm water (90%)
* 21g fine salt (3%)
* some olive oil
* herbs, garlic and more salt for toppings

## steps
Creating the Dough
1. Mix flour, sourdough starter and water until a rough, wet dough has formed.
2. Fold the dough using a dough scraper until a smooth dough has formed.
3. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 30 minutes for autolysis.
4. Take the dough out of the bowl onto the kitchen surface and add salt.
5. Mix in the salt with the slap and fold technique until firm. Place back into the bowl and cover.

First Rise
1. Coil fold the dough every 30-60 minutes a couple of times
2. Leave the bowl out in room temperature and cover with some ceran wrap

Second Rise
1. After about 8-16h (or until the dough doubles), spread some olive oil in the oven dish
2. Fold the dough in the bowl to release some air
3. Dump the dough into the pan and use your fingers to dimple and spread it
4. Cover with some ceran wrap again and leave out in room temperature for 4-6h

Baking
1. Preheat the oven to 250°C (top&bottom heat).
2. Sprinkle toppings on the focaccia and dimple them in a bit.
3. Turn the oven down to 220°C and bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.
4. Take it out afterwards and let it cool a bit in the pan (30 minutes), before slicing

## notes
* besides garlic, salt, olive oil and rosemary, you can use some other toppings like: cherry tomatoes, olives
* instead of ceranwrap, you can use a baking pan or another flat and solid cooking object. The dough won't stick to it as much.
* You can switch the durations of the first&second rises if it better suits your schedule. i.e.: Let rise for 4h in the bowl in the evening, then transfer to the baking dish overnight
